			Study Title: Crowds Cure Cancer: Crowd-sourcing ground-truth measurements on publicly available imaging data
			</h4>
			<h4>Principal Investigator: Gordon J. Harris, PhD</h4>
			<p>The purpose of this research study is to crowd-source ground-truth measurements on publicly available datasets at the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) annual meeting. This project is sponsored by the Tumor Imaging Metrics Core and Precision Imaging Metrics at Massachusetts General Hospital.</p>
			<p>Publicly available imaging datasets, such as The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), are a potential rich resource to help to advance artificial intelligence and machine learning research in cancer prevention, diagnosis, monitoring and treatment. But, unfortunately, these imaging datasets often lack tumor measurement and labels. We need your help to create ground-truth measurements, which could be used by researchers to train machine learning models.</p>
			<p>You will be asked to provide your email address in order to create an account in the Crowds Cure Cancer website and password recovery, if necessary. Email addresses will also be used to notify participants when annotations are publicly available on TCIA. You will also be asked to provide your name if you would like to be acknowledged at RSNA 2019 for your participation. The participant with the who makes the most measurements at RSNA 2019 will be acknowledged at an award ceremony at RSNA 2020. You are not required to provide your name unless you want your participation to be acknowledged during the RSNA. Data is encrypted during transmission and storage, limiting the risk of breach of confidentiality. Participant email addresses and names will be destroyed at the end of the project.</p>
			<p>The measurement data that you create may be used or shared with other researchers without your additional informed consent. Your personal information will not be shared. There are no known risks associated with participation; the data will not be used in clinical care. Participation is voluntary and can stop at any time. For clinicians and trainee volunteers, deciding not to participate will not affect your professional standing or evaluations in your program or department.</p>
			<p>If you have any questions regarding this research project, please contact the Principal Investigator, Gordon J. Harris, PhD at gjharris@partners.org.</p>
			<p>If youâ€™d like to speak to someone not involved in this research about your rights as a research participant, or any concerns or complaints that you may have about the research, contact the Partners Human Research Committee at (857) 282-1900.</p>
